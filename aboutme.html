    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Whilst Jaser is in school, he is working towards having good grades and making sure is on top of everything. His first language is Spanish and has struggled in his first couple of years of school due to the language barrier. He has overcome the language barrier and is now on his way to working towards a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. Jaser is working hard and maintaining his grades all while planning for his coming years in dual enrollment and college. He has mentally prepared himself for the challenges he will face. He knows it will be difficult but he is willing to push through to earn a valuable place in the economy. Jaser values discipline more than anything as he knows motivation is not enough to get him where he needs to be. He knows that discipline is eternal while motivation burns out. He cares for his health and knows that he must also be strong physically as well as mentally/spiritually. Some short-term goals he hopes to accomplish in the near future include excelling in most subjects and scoring high on the up-and-coming SAT. He also hopes to get ahead in math so that he can take dual enrollment at an earlier stage. Jaser wants to be known for becoming a revolutionary problem-solver alongside the help of his code. He wants to be known for his drive and discipline in his work.</p>
